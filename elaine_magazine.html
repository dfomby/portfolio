<p>Design Style:<br>
‚ùñ Lively, Playful yet Cohesive<br>
The design style should be unique and eye-catching, but still have a structured formatting.
The lively and playful design style communicates the type of design style that the designer used
in her works.</p>
<p>I first drafted my design by drawing out how I wanted the images and the texts to go together for the second and third pages. Through my drawing, I wanted to convey the gestalt idea of closure, as even though the circles are cut off on the pages, the reader is able to connect the circle lines mentally as if they were continuous. These circles also follow the principle of continuance as the strokes for the circles continue across pages 2-3.</p>
