                        <p>Design Style:<br>
                            ‚ùñ Lively, Playful yet Cohesive<br>
                            The design style should be unique and eye-catching, but still have a structured formatting.
                            The lively and playful design style communicates the type of design style that the designer
                            used
                            in her works. 2 of her designs that reflect this design style will be used in the magazine.
                        <h3><strong>Results</strong></h3>
                        <p>This logo was created using Adobe InDesign.</p>
                        <p>Magazine Cover:</p>
                        <p>For the front page of the magazine, I incorporated a picture of Elaine Cohen embedded in a
                            circle that's cutting off the page, in order to convey her picture in a lively and playful
                            style.</p>
                        <p>Inside Pages 2-3:</p>
                        <p>In order to properly convey Elaine Cohen's design style, I decided that I would use images
                            for each page embedded in a cut-off circle. I used the gestalt idea of closure, as even
                            though the circles are cut off on the pages, the reader is able to connect the circle lines
                            mentally as if they were continuous. These circles also follow the principle of continuance
                            as the strokes for the circles continue across pages 2-3. I decided that the the text should
                            wrap around the circle designs I made to create a playful effect, conveying Elaine Cohen's
                            design style. The images I used were designs made by Elaine Cohen, and the images have the
                            same matching colors, creating a color scheme for pages 2-3. The borders of the circles are
                            blue to connect to the front page's blue colors scheme.</p>
