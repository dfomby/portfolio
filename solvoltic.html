             <h2>Solvoltic</h2>

install on their own and use on their balconies. They enable more people to invest in and use solar
energy to power home electronics.</h3>

<p><strong>Potential Users/Clients:</strong><br>
People looking to invest in solar energy to power their homes.<br>
People looking to use an eco-friendly alternative that's easy to set up.</p>
<p><strong>The company’s purpose:</strong> Enable people to invest in solar energy.<br>
The company needs to have an ideal logo that both sticks out and represents their purpose.</p>

<p><strong>Researching the purpose of solar panels:</strong><br>
❖ Reduce reliance on fossil fuels (eco-friendly alternative)<br>
❖ Generating electricity for households, reducing electricity costs overtime</p>
    <p>This logo was created using Adobe Illustrator</p>
    <p>To make the logo both stand out and convey the company's purpose, I decided that the logo should consist of both a solar panel and a leaf. Seeing the solar panel will make potential customers instantly aware that this is a solar panel company. Since most people associate the symbol of a leaf with eco-friendly, I placed a leaf directly in the middle of the logo, making it stand out as much as possible, so that even at a glance customers can tell that this product will be eco-friendly.</p>
